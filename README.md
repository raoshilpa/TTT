The original code for the Tic Tac Toe game is not mine; I borrowed it to modify. Source is https://dev.to/jamesshah/the-classic-tictactoe-game-in-python-cpi; original code written in Automate the Boring Stuff with Python: Practical Programming for Total Beginners (https://www.amazon.in/Automate-Boring-Stuff-Python-Programming-ebook/dp/B00WJ049VU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=36GA0S183R1H9&keywords=automate+the+boring+stuff+with+python&qid=1573710172&sprefix=Automate+t,aps,372&sr=8-1&linkCode=sl1&tag=bytetales-21&linkId=365febe171431796e07d4419d0a621ca&language=en_IN).

The source code for the Minimax file I'm playing around with is from user rootshadow's contribution on Geeksforgeeks: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-1-introduction/

Thanks for stopping by. I'm experimenting with implementing the minimax algorithm into a simple Tic Tac Toe game, to learn more about game theory, decision trees, and AI. I've made good progress so far, and I'm interested in how we could apply a game theory algorithm like minimax to geofencing for high altitude balloons (i.e UCLA Bruinspace's Overseer project). I hope to explore that in the future.
